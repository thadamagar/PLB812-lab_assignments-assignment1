Genome fasta and gene annotation
Following steps were taken to have genome fasta and gene annotation
1. gff and fa.gz files for my assigned species were downloaded from the phytosome  (https://data.jgi.doe.gov/refine-download/phytozome?restoreid=173590)
2. these files were uploaded to the hpcc using sftp command.
3. these files were in gz format which was unzipped with gunzip command.
4. first 10 lines were read using head n10 command.

Fastq file
Following steps were taken to have fastq files
1. conda environment was created with SRA tool (hardest step for me)
2. SRR files of my assigned spp. were then downloaded using Prefetch command.
3. SRR files were converted into fastq format using fastq-dump command
4. first 10 lines were read using n10 head command.
